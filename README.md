How can I ensure that my code, program, or software is functional and secure?
-	I can ensure that the code I have produced, and any code I create in the future is functional and secure by following essential testing protocols. These protocols include static and dynamic testing, as well as creating automated software testing tools. These automated tests can ensure that each individual feature of my software is secure and functional in a much more efficient way than by doing so manually. These tests allow for tests to be run incrementally throughout the software development lifecycle.


How do I interpret user needs and incorporate them into a program?
-	The best way to transform user needs into software functionality is to create use cases and then build functionality to satisfy them. 


How do I approach designing software?
-	The best way to approach designing software is to understand client requirements and then format them as use cases and desired outcomes, and then build software functionality that satisfies those requirements and use cases.
